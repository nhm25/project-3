      <h1>Magic The Gathering: Mana</h1>
      <h2 id="intro">Intro to Mana</h2>
      <p id="intro-desc">Mana is the energy that is required in order to cast spells in MTG. It comes from lands that you control. Each land can produce one mana of a certain color each turn. This mana does not stack, so you must plan how to use it each turn. Sometimes it's good to leave certain mana untapped after your turn, as you can use that to cast instants that your opponent may not be expecting during their turn. Here, we will go over the five different colors of mana</p>

    <h1>Top 3 Coolest Items in Fortnite</h1>
    <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h3>
    <p>These are the top 3 coolest items in my opinion. That's all.</p>

    <div class="demogorgon">
      <h2>1. Demogorgon</h2>
      <img src="media/demogorgon.jpg" alt="Demogorgon">
      <p>I think this skin is pretty cool because it represents an important character from the show Stranger Things. It
        looks basic at first glance, but it has more features than meets the eye. This skin can open its head/mouth in
        certain situations, revealing a bunch of sharp teeth. Not many other skins can do this sort of thing, which
        makes this one pretty unique and awesome. This skin may never come back to the item shop, too, which makes it
        one of the rarest items in Fortnite.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lava">
      <h2>2. Lavawing</h2>
      <img src="media/lavawing.jpg" alt="Lavawing">
      <p>This glider is one of my favorites as it contains so much detail to it. It's also pretty cool to ride a dragon.
        This dragon spits fire while you glide, instilling fear within opponents before you even land. This is also a
        very rare glider, which only adds onto its coolness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skull">
      <h2>3. Demon Skull</h2>
      <img src="media/demonskull.jpg" alt="Demon Skull">
      <p>The Demon Skull pickaxe is very cool as it's very detailed and it's very rare. It hasn't come back onto the
        item shop in over a year. Unlike the other two items here, this one isn't included in a set. It's just a random
        pickaxe. It's very noticeable in game, so it's a good item to show off with if you're not afraid of being
        spotted by an opponent off in the distance.</p>

      <h2>BONUS!</h2>
      <p>Here's some audio of the Demon Skull pickaxe being swung:</p>
